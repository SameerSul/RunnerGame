A small little Pygame project I was working in which the user plays as a character and has to avoid obstacles, similar to the dinosaur game on chrome. This project helped me learn about rectangles in Pygame and how collisions work and overall allowed me to gain a powerful understanding of these concepts.
I hope you enjoy :)
