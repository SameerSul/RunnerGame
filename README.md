Banking-System
A small project I worked on to get myself back into Python after a long hiatus. It's really simple and requires basic OOP and Python understanding.

User can create a bank account, update it as they see fit, I hope to take this a couple steps further by adding GUI and allowing user data to be saved on a database, to make it more realistic!
